# Research

My research explores the economic dimensions of energy systems and their environmental implications. Specifically, I focus on:

- **Energy system optimization**: Developing and improving models that optimize multi-energy systems, focusing on efficiency, sustainability, and market integration.
- **Environmental impact analysis**: Assessing the social cost of renewable energy projects, with particular emphasis on wind and solar power.
- **Climate policy**: Analyzing how different market-based mechanisms, such as carbon pricing and emissions trading systems, can facilitate the transition to cleaner energy.
