I am an economist with a degree from the University of Vienna, specializing in the economic analysis of power systems.
Currently, I work as a researcher at [BOKU University](https://www.boku.ac.at) and as a lead quantitative analyst for 
[Wien Energie](https://www.wienenergie.at). 
 
My research focuses on power system modeling and environmental economics, with a particular interest in understanding 
the limitations of perfect competition assumptions in power system models.
Currently, I focus on the social cost of electricity generation technologies.

Professionally, I have worked in both consultancy and strategic roles in the energy sector, advising municipal as well 
as multinational companies on investment strategies and decarbonization efforts.

I have experience in scientific programming with Python and GAMS, having developed tools such as _medea_ and _cleo_ to 
analyze renewable energy systems. 
Alongside my industry work, I am completing my PhD at BOKU University and have published in several leading journals in 
the field. 

I look forward to continuing my research while supporting strategic decision-making in the energy sector.

### Research Interests:
* Externalities of renewable electricity generation technologies, particularly wind power
* Power system modeling
* Investment in energy infrastructures
