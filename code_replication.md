# Code & Replication

This section provides access to open-source code and replication material from my research. All repositories are hosted on GitHub and support the analysis and replication of studies in energy economics and environmental systems.

1. **[medea](https://github.com/inwe-boku/medea)**  
   A Python package for modeling multi-energy demand systems, developed to support energy system optimization research.

2. **[medea data (AT/DE)](https://github.com/inwe-boku/medea_data_atde)**  
   Energy demand datasets for Austria and Germany, specifically for use with medea.

3. **[cleo](https://github.com/sebwehrle/cleo)**  
   A toolbox for processing wind resource data from the GWA3 and enriching it with further high-resolution spatial datasets.

4. **[SCOW (Social Cost of Wind Power)](https://github.com/inwe-boku/scow)**  
   Replication code for the paper titled "Inferring Local Social Cost of Wind Power" published in *Energy Economics*. The code supports replication of the analysis on the social and economic impacts of wind power installations.
